      <description>Tubefilter: &amp;#8220;YouTube has quite suddenly become a key player in Netflix‘s plans to acquire Warner Bros. Discovery. The streamer announced last week that it would get a Hollywood level-up by purchasing Warner Bros. Discovery’s studio and streaming assets in a deal valued at $82.7 billion (aka $27.75 per share). That deal came after a tense bidding war–and one of the losers isn’t going down without a fight.&amp;#8221;</description>

      <description>New York Times: This link goes to a gift article. &amp;#8220;For six months, Apple distributed an app called ICEBlock that allowed users to alert people when they saw Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents. But after the Trump administration complained that the app endangered officers, Apple removed it. On Monday, the app developer, Joshua Aaron, sued top Trump administration officials, accusing them of pressuring Apple to stifle his free speech and his right to create, distribute and promote ICEBlock.&amp;#8221;</description>

      <title>How Google Maps quietly allocates survival across London’s restaurants &amp;#8211; and how I built a dashboard to see through it</title>
      <link>https://laurenleek.substack.com/p/how-google-maps-quietly-allocates</link>
      <description>Lauren Leek: &amp;#8220;I built the London food dashboard. The dashboard currently allows users to search by name and filter by underrated gems (identified by my machine learning algorithm), cuisine, borough, price level, min rating, and review volume. It is still very much a version-one prototype &amp;#8211; but it is already a working microscope into London’s algorithmic food economy.&amp;#8221;</description>

      <description>Online Journalism Blog: &amp;#8220;Carefully curated explainers might not boost the ego of a reporter who sees themselves as a dogged news hound, but we should probably still be writing them to serve audiences and compete with AI-generated alternatives — especially given their propensity to repeat false claims. It is particularly the case if we are have any mission to give a voice to the voiceless — by definition underrepresented in AI training data.&amp;#8221;</description>

      <title>Datacenters are hoarding grid power just in case, says Uptime Institute</title>
      <link>https://www.theregister.com/2025/12/08/uptime_institute_datacenter_grid/</link>
      <description>The Register: &amp;#8220;The advisory body found that datacenter power use remains largely constant, with major demand changes typically coming from business expansion. Operators routinely reserve excess capacity for potential future growth, blocking other users from that allocation even though it sits unused.&amp;#8221;</description>

      <description>Alex Chan: &amp;#8220;I want to remember social media, and not just as a vague memory. I want to remember exactly what I read, what I saw, what I wrote. If I was born 50 years ago, I’m the sort of person who’d keep a scrapbook full of letters and postcards – physical traces of the people who mattered to me. Today, those traces are digital. I don’t trust the Internet to remember for me, so I’ve built my own scrapbook of social media. It’s a place where I can save the posts that shaped me, delighted me, or just stuck in my mind.&amp;#8221;</description>

      <description>Ars Technica: &amp;#8220;In videos shared by users, some of the AI-generated voice work was eerily deadpan. In one telling video Ash Lynx from Banana Fish tries to awaken a child who has been shot while speaking in a detached, dry tone. &amp;#8216;Don’t leave me please,”&amp;#8217; he states like a robot before confronting someone without any anger in his voice. The person responds in a similarly emotionless manner.&amp;#8221;</description>

      <description>Gizmodo: &amp;#8220;The latest work of the artist Beeple, best known for selling a piece of NFT artwork to some poor schmuck for $69 million at the height of that craze, has attached the heads of the billionaires and some other notable figures to the bodies of robot dogs who aimlessly walk around and take pictures that are pooped out of their machine back ends.

      <description>BBC: &amp;#8220;Throughout 2025, several female content creators have spoken out about concerns of their safety, particularly when attending public events. In March, three US Twitch streamers, Cinna, Valkyrae and Emiru, were taking part in a week-long marathon stream when a man threatened to kill them. Then, at the annual streamer event TwitchCon in October, a man from the crowd grabbed Emiru and tried to kiss her without her consent.&amp;#8221;</description>

      <description>Mashable: &amp;#8220;According to a new study published this week in Nature, audiovisual glitches can have far-reaching affects on users that extend beyond expected nuisances, but which have the power to fundamentally impact major areas of our life, including the outcome of a job interview, trust in medical professionals, and the result of legal proceedings. And for people who don&amp;#8217;t have reliable internet access, including digitally disconnected, rural, or low-income households, the impact may be even more severe.&amp;#8221;</description>
