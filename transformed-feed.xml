      <description>New-to-Me, I missed the launch last year: From the About page: &amp;#8220;The Hydrant Directory is a free design resource created from public infrastructure. Each hydrant has been processed into color palettes for free use by artists and designers.&amp;#8221; I love the intersection of art and infrastructure.</description>

      <link>https://www.ibtimes.com/fake-epstein-suicide-video-sparks-new-questions-about-doj-oversight-3793512</link>
      <description>International Business Times: &amp;#8220;In a stunning lapse of protocol that has drawn bipartisan condemnation, the US Department of Justice (DOJ) briefly released a fabricated video purporting to show the suicide of disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein. The 12-second clip, uploaded to the DOJ&amp;#8217;s official website on Monday as part of a court-mandated file dump, appeared to depict Epstein in his cell at the Metropolitan Correctional Center (MCC) during the early hours of 10 August 2019.&amp;#8221;</description>

      <title>Boys at her school shared AI-generated, nude images of her. After a fight, she was the one expelled</title>
      <link>https://apnews.com/article/school-deepfake-nude-ai-cyberbullying-0ead324241cf390e1a7f3378853f23cb</link>
      <description>Associated Press: &amp;#8220;The girls begged for help, first from a school guidance counselor and then from a sheriff’s deputy assigned to their school. But the images were shared on Snapchat, an app that deletes messages seconds after they’re viewed, and the adults couldn’t find them. The principal had doubts they even existed. Among the kids, the pictures were still spreading. When the 13-year-old girl stepped onto the Lafourche Parish school bus at the end of the day, a classmate was showing one of them to a friend.&amp;#8221;</description>

      <description>Hackaday: &amp;#8220;The &amp;#8216;Marauder’s Map&amp;#8217; is a magical artifact from the Harry Potter franchise. That sort of magic isn’t real, but as Arthur C.

Or, rather, [Dave] on the YouTube Channel Dave’s Armoury can make it.&amp;#8221; Good evening, Internet&amp;#8230;</description>

Users can also adjust the way the bot organizes its responses, such as how frequently it generates lists, as well as the amount of emojis it employs, in addition to its base style and tone. There&amp;#8217;s still no option to exclude emojis entirely.&amp;#8221;</description>

      <description>Tubefilter: &amp;#8220;In the memo, which was viewed by Axios, TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew told his staff that TikTok U.S. will be sold to a consortium led by tech company Oracle, private equity firm Silver Lake, and Emerati-backed investors at MGX. The deal still needs to be officially rubber-stamped by the Chinese government (more on that in a bit), but Chew wrote that the deal is expected to close on January 22, 2026.&amp;#8221;</description>

      <description>International Business Times: &amp;#8220;A hack on the startup Doublespeed has uncovered a secretive network of 1,100 smartphones used to run hundreds of AI-generated TikTok accounts. Pexels Recent discoveries of phone farms reveal a massive operation where AI-generated influencers are saturating TikTok with hidden advertisements. These automated accounts mimic real creators so effectively that many viewers fail to realise they are watching a programmed marketing campaign. As technology advances, the line between genuine content and silent digital promotion continues to vanish.&amp;#8221;</description>

      <description>Anna&amp;#8217;s Archive: &amp;#8220;Anna’s Archive normally focuses on text (e.g. books and papers). We explained in &amp;#8216;The critical window of shadow libraries&amp;#8217; that we do this because text has the highest information density. But our mission (preserving humanity’s knowledge and culture) doesn’t distinguish among media types. Sometimes an opportunity comes along outside of text. This is such a case. A while ago, we discovered a way to scrape Spotify at scale. We saw a role for us here to build a music archive primarily aimed at preservation.&amp;#8221;</description>

      <link>https://mashable.com/article/waymo-robotaxi-footage-wrong-side-of-road-viral-video</link>
      <description>Mashable: &amp;#8220;A recent viral video shows a driverless Waymo robotaxi driving straight into oncoming traffic in Austin, Texas. The post has garnered lots of upvotes on Reddit. In the video, you see that the robotaxi crawls to a halt facing the wrong direction, staring down oncoming traffic. Obviously out of sorts, it has its right turn signal on before whipping left into a gas station.&amp;#8221;</description>

      <description>TechSpot: &amp;#8220;The strange legal fight between Disney and a 1970s horror movie production company over the CGI recreation of Peter Cushing in 2016&amp;#8217;s Rogue One: A Star Wars Story has ended. Unsurprisingly, the lawsuit has been thrown out after a judge found in favor of Disney and dismissed the claim.&amp;#8221;</description>

      <description>Utah State University: &amp;#8220;Tracking the sources of excessive sediment in the Mississippi River Basin (MRB) has proven to be a vexing and economically important question for the last few decades &amp;#8230; Now, the first basin-wide sediment fingerprinting database makes it possible to track where sediment is coming from and how it moves through the entire basin, allowing managers and researchers to better understand water quality, measure the health of waterways, minimize erosion and identify sources of pollution.&amp;#8221;</description>

      <description>Geeks Are Sexy: &amp;#8220;The Wall Street Journal let an AI named Claudius run a vending machine as a &amp;#8216;real-world stress test.&amp;#8217; It started with $1,000, full autonomy, and one very basic mission: sell snacks, make money, don’t collapse society. Within days, Claudius had lost more than its entire budget, declared an Ultra-Capitalist Free-For-All, gave everything away for free, bought a PlayStation 5 &amp;#8216;for marketing,&amp;#8217; and ordered a live fish to boost employee morale.&amp;#8221;</description>

      <description>Tom&amp;#8217;s Hardware: &amp;#8220;This move meant that DTE Energy did not have to go through a lengthy hearing, wherein opposing groups could seek expert testimony and present evidence to challenge DTE’s claims.

      <description>Construction Dive: &amp;#8220;In their letter to Congress, the environmental organizations stated that tripling the number of data centers in the next five years would require as much electricity as about 30 million households, as much water as about 18.5 million households and contribute to escalating electricity costs.  Bloomberg reported in September that wholesale power costs as much as 267% more than it did five years ago in areas near data centers.&amp;#8221;</description>

      <description>GameSpot: &amp;#8220;Sega Channel launched in 1994 and was one of the first subscription-based, digital game services, beaming new games and content directly to players&amp;#8217; consoles through a television cable.

      <description>The Register: &amp;#8220;You want artificial general intelligence (AGI)? Current-day processors aren&amp;#8217;t powerful enough to make it happen and our ability to scale up may soon be coming to an end, argues well-known researcher Tim Dettmers.&amp;#8221; Good morning, Internet&amp;#8230;</description>

      <description>WTTW: &amp;#8220;Tucked in a two-sentence footnote in a voluminous court opinion, a federal judge recently called out immigration agents using artificial intelligence to write use-of-force reports, raising concerns that it could lead to inaccuracies and further erode public confidence in how police have handled the immigration crackdown in the Chicago area and ensuing protests.&amp;#8221;</description>

      <title>Hard problems in social media archiving</title>
      <link>https://alexwlchan.net/2025/hard-problems-in-social-media-archiving/?ref=rss</link>
      <description>Alex Chan: &amp;#8220;Institutional archiving has different constraints to individual collections – institutions serve a much wider audience, so their decisions need consistency and boundaries. My own scrapbook is tiny and personal, and comparing it alongside institutional efforts really highlights the differences and difficulties. It’s why I usually call it a &amp;#8216;scrapbook&amp;#8217;, not an &amp;#8216;archive&amp;#8217;: it’s informal and a bit chaotic, and that’s fine because it’s only for me. In this post, I’ll explain what I see as the key issues facing institutional social media archiving: what can be saved, what resists preservation, and how context is so hard to keep.&amp;#8221;</description>

      <title>When people see themselves in science, they trust it more</title>
      <link>https://www.rochester.edu/newscenter/demographic-representation-public-trust-science-688912/</link>
      <description>University of Rochester: &amp;#8220;White men make up about two-thirds of the scientific workforce in the United States, and nearly all scientists—92 percent—are from non-rural areas, according to the study. That the scientific community looks a lot less like the country it serves is more than symbolic, the authors argue. Indeed, it influences how different groups of people trust scientists and scientific institutions, and how likely recommendations of scientists are to become public policy.&amp;#8221; Good afternoon, Internet&amp;#8230;</description>
