      <description>The Conversation: &amp;#8220;The words of the year aren’t just a fun peek into new slang and language changes, they also tell us quite a bit about the worries, trends and obsessions of the English-speaking world. And this year’s list has one clear theme. In 2025, artificial intelligence (AI) played a huge role in our offices, social media feeds, music and film, and now – dictionaries.&amp;#8221; Good afternoon, Internet&amp;#8230;</description>

      <description>Droid Life: &amp;#8220;You may have forgotten the timeline, but Google was pushing to force all off of Google Assistant and onto Gemini by the end of this year.

      <description>Construction Dive: &amp;#8220;In their letter to Congress, the environmental organizations stated that tripling the number of data centers in the next five years would require as much electricity as about 30 million households, as much water as about 18.5 million households and contribute to escalating electricity costs.  Bloomberg reported in September that wholesale power costs as much as 267% more than it did five years ago in areas near data centers.&amp;#8221;</description>

      <description>GameSpot: &amp;#8220;Sega Channel launched in 1994 and was one of the first subscription-based, digital game services, beaming new games and content directly to players&amp;#8217; consoles through a television cable. The service shut down in 1998, and since then many of the exclusive games and content available on the service were thought to be gone forever. That is, until the Video Game History Foundation embarked on a quest to see the channel&amp;#8217;s unique history, and its content, preserved.&amp;#8221;</description>

      <description>Moscow Times: &amp;#8220;Disruptions to satellite navigation have become increasingly common in Russia as the military deploys anti-drone systems to counter Ukrainian attacks that rely on GPS guidance. Those measures have included signal jamming and spoofing, particularly near sensitive locations such as the Kremlin, causing widespread problems for civilian navigation.&amp;#8221;</description>

      <title>Hard problems in social media archiving</title>
      <link>https://alexwlchan.net/2025/hard-problems-in-social-media-archiving/?ref=rss</link>
      <description>Alex Chan: &amp;#8220;Institutional archiving has different constraints to individual collections – institutions serve a much wider audience, so their decisions need consistency and boundaries. My own scrapbook is tiny and personal, and comparing it alongside institutional efforts really highlights the differences and difficulties. It’s why I usually call it a &amp;#8216;scrapbook&amp;#8217;, not an &amp;#8216;archive&amp;#8217;: it’s informal and a bit chaotic, and that’s fine because it’s only for me. In this post, I’ll explain what I see as the key issues facing institutional social media archiving: what can be saved, what resists preservation, and how context is so hard to keep.&amp;#8221;</description>

      <description>University of Rochester: &amp;#8220;White men make up about two-thirds of the scientific workforce in the United States, and nearly all scientists—92 percent—are from non-rural areas, according to the study. That the scientific community looks a lot less like the country it serves is more than symbolic, the authors argue. Indeed, it influences how different groups of people trust scientists and scientific institutions, and how likely recommendations of scientists are to become public policy.&amp;#8221; Good afternoon, Internet&amp;#8230;</description>

But those guardrails have proved woefully inadequate for the kind of technological leaps OpenAI’s tools represent.&amp;#8221;</description>

      <description>Tubefilter: &amp;#8220;YouTube has quite suddenly become a key player in Netflix‘s plans to acquire Warner Bros. Discovery. The streamer announced last week that it would get a Hollywood level-up by purchasing Warner Bros. Discovery’s studio and streaming assets in a deal valued at $82.7 billion (aka $27.75 per share). That deal came after a tense bidding war–and one of the losers isn’t going down without a fight.&amp;#8221;</description>
