      <title>Prime Video pulls eerily emotionless AI-generated anime dubs after complaints</title>
      <link>https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/12/prime-video-pulls-eerily-emotionless-ai-generated-anime-dubs-after-complaints/</link>
      <description>&amp;#8220;In videos shared by users, some of the AI-generated voice work was eerily deadpan. In one telling video Ash Lynx from Banana Fish tries to awaken a child who has been shot while speaking in a detached, dry tone. &amp;#8216;Don’t leave me please,”&amp;#8217; he states like a robot before confronting someone without any anger in his voice. The person responds in a similarly emotionless manner.&amp;#8221;</description>

      <description>&amp;#8220;The latest work of the artist Beeple, best known for selling a piece of NFT artwork to some poor schmuck for $69 million at the height of that craze, has attached the heads of the billionaires and some other notable figures to the bodies of robot dogs who aimlessly walk around and take pictures that are pooped out of their machine back ends. It is a comment on…something, for sure.&amp;#8221;</description>

      <description>&amp;#8220;Throughout 2025, several female content creators have spoken out about concerns of their safety, particularly when attending public events. In March, three US Twitch streamers, Cinna, Valkyrae and Emiru, were taking part in a week-long marathon stream when a man threatened to kill them. Then, at the annual streamer event TwitchCon in October, a man from the crowd grabbed Emiru and tried to kiss her without her consent.&amp;#8221;</description>

      <title>People negatively judge others who glitch on video calls, according to study</title>

      <description>&amp;#8220;According to a new study published this week in Nature, audiovisual glitches can have far-reaching affects on users that extend beyond expected nuisances, but which have the power to fundamentally impact major areas of our life, including the outcome of a job interview, trust in medical professionals, and the result of legal proceedings. And for people who don&amp;#8217;t have reliable internet access, including digitally disconnected, rural, or low-income households, the impact may be even more severe.&amp;#8221;</description>

      <description>&amp;#8220;IBM CEO Arvind Krishna used an appearance on The Verge’s Decoder podcast to question whether the capital spending now underway in pursuit of AGI can ever pay for itself. Krishna said today’s figures for constructing and populating large AI data centers place the industry on a trajectory where roughly $8 trillion of cumulative commitments would require around $800 billion of annual profit simply to service the cost of capital.&amp;#8221;</description>

The 16GB memory variants of the Compute Module 5 are going up by $20 and now start at $140. This is a bummer and we know who to thank.

      <description>&amp;#8220;These AI-generated products look like quality items, which the scammers then pitch at affordable prices. When a user clicks on the ad, which the scammer paid Facebook to serve, they are sent to the thieves&amp;#8217; e-commerce storefront. The consumer makes their purchase without realizing the item is a fake. They&amp;#8217;ll either receive a cheap imitation product, or never receive any item at all.&amp;#8221;</description>

      <link>https://groundup.org.za/article/facebook-promotes-rubbish-because-it-doesnt-understand-indigenous-languages/</link>
      <description>&amp;#8220;Facebook is actively promoting clickbait and the spread of fake news &amp;#8211; and rewarding the people who create it. This is especially true in regions like the Vhembe district, where the tech giant’s algorithms battle to understand local languages. The result is that a new generation of content creators is having a field day posting misinformation and disinformation and being paid for it, with little to no regard for the consequences of their actions.&amp;#8221;</description>

      <description>This link goes to a gift article. &amp;#8220;Smugglers, money launderers and people facing sanctions once relied on diamonds, gold and artwork to store illicit fortunes. The luxury goods could help hide wealth but were cumbersome to move and hard to spend. Now, criminals have a far more practical alternative: stablecoins, a cryptocurrency tied to the U.S. dollar that exists largely beyond traditional financial oversight.&amp;#8221;</description>

      <description>&amp;#8220;OpenAI is testing another new way to expose the complicated processes at work inside large language models. Researchers at the company can make an LLM produce what they call a confession, in which the model explains how it carried out a task and (most of the time) owns up to any bad behavior.&amp;#8221;</description>

We were thrilled that so many people at TwitchCon had a blast playing it. You can download your own physical deck of Data War here, and now the chaos comes to your browser.

      <description>&amp;#8220;A new study from UNC-Chapel Hill researchers shows that advanced artificial intelligence tools, specifically large language models (LLMs), can accurately determine the locations where plant specimens were originally collected, a process known as georeferencing. This task has traditionally been slow, expensive and dependent on significant manual effort. The team found that LLMs can complete this work with near-human accuracy while being significantly faster and more cost-effective.&amp;#8221; Good afternoon, Internet&amp;#8230;</description>
