      <description>Tubefilter: &amp;#8220;YouTube has quite suddenly become a key player in Netflix‘s plans to acquire Warner Bros. Discovery. The streamer announced last week that it would get a Hollywood level-up by purchasing Warner Bros. Discovery’s studio and streaming assets in a deal valued at $82.7 billion (aka $27.75 per share). That deal came after a tense bidding war–and one of the losers isn’t going down without a fight.&amp;#8221;</description>

      <description>New York Times: This link goes to a gift article. &amp;#8220;For six months, Apple distributed an app called ICEBlock that allowed users to alert people when they saw Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents.

      <description>WrestleZone: &amp;#8220;WWE owns decades of historic footage, and for the past few years, all of it has lived on Peacock instead of the WWE Network. The setup might change soon as Fightful Select reported that WWE’s streaming deal with Peacock ends at the end of 2026. This leads many fans to wonder what will happen to WWE’s massive video library.&amp;#8221;</description>

      <description>Online Journalism Blog: &amp;#8220;Carefully curated explainers might not boost the ego of a reporter who sees themselves as a dogged news hound, but we should probably still be writing them to serve audiences and compete with AI-generated alternatives — especially given their propensity to repeat false claims. It is particularly the case if we are have any mission to give a voice to the voiceless — by definition underrepresented in AI training data.&amp;#8221;</description>

      <description>The Register: &amp;#8220;The advisory body found that datacenter power use remains largely constant, with major demand changes typically coming from business expansion. Operators routinely reserve excess capacity for potential future growth, blocking other users from that allocation even though it sits unused.&amp;#8221;</description>

      <description>Alex Chan: &amp;#8220;I want to remember social media, and not just as a vague memory. I want to remember exactly what I read, what I saw, what I wrote. If I was born 50 years ago, I’m the sort of person who’d keep a scrapbook full of letters and postcards – physical traces of the people who mattered to me. Today, those traces are digital. I don’t trust the Internet to remember for me, so I’ve built my own scrapbook of social media. It’s a place where I can save the posts that shaped me, delighted me, or just stuck in my mind.&amp;#8221;</description>
