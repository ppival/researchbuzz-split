      <description>Politico: &amp;#8220;A year after it was cemented — and billed as a model that could succeed where entire countries and continents had fallen short — the agreement is tangled in budget cuts, bureaucratic infighting and unresolved questions about who controls the money, leaving journalists empty-handed and casting doubt on whether the lofty experiment will ever live up to its promise.&amp;#8221;</description>

      <title>Stop the slop by disabling AI features in Chrome</title>

      <description>The Register: &amp;#8220;Most of today’s desktop web browsers come with a ton of built-in AI features, but the good news is that, in most cases, no one is forcing you to use them, and you can at least hide them from view. Removing the most egregious AI tools from Chrome is pretty simple, but it requires a few steps.&amp;#8221;</description>

      <description>Lifehacker: &amp;#8221; My own grocery lists aren’t all that long, but I still find myself juggling my phone and a scrap of paper as I walk around the store, checking for digital coupons and trying to do quick math.

      <description>Hackaday: &amp;#8220;What can one expect from 3D printing an 8″ Newtonian telescope? [Molly Wakeling] shares her thoughts after doing exactly that. The performance was on par with any solid 8″ telescope, but in the end it wasn’t really any cheaper than purchasing a manufactured unit. Does that mean it wasn’t worth it? Not at all!&amp;#8221; Good morning, Internet&amp;#8230;</description>

      <description>Tom&amp;#8217;s Hardware: &amp;#8220;We’ve already sketched out the explosive but almost accidental success that the youthful AltaVista would see.

      <description>TechCrunch: &amp;#8220;Even as OpenAI works to harden its Atlas AI browser against cyberattacks, the company admits that prompt injections, a type of attack that manipulates AI agents to follow malicious instructions often hidden in web pages or emails, is a risk that’s not going away anytime soon — raising questions about how safely AI agents can operate on the open web.&amp;#8221;</description>

      <description>Rick Carlino: &amp;#8220;Working with Meshtastic has been fun. It&amp;#8217;s impressive how a few inexpensive devices can form a communications network covering many miles. The system is limited, but within those constraints it feels magical to send a message into the ether and have it hop across a county line to a stranger. Meshtastic isn&amp;#8217;t very useful alone, but as more people join, the mesh becomes stronger and more useful for everyone.&amp;#8221; Good morning, Internet&amp;#8230;</description>

      <description>BBC: &amp;#8220;A senior scholar at the Hermitage, Russia&amp;#8217;s largest art museum in St Petersburg, [Alexander Butyagin] has led the museum&amp;#8217;s expedition at the site of Myrmekion in Crimea since 1999, well before Russia&amp;#8217;s illegal landgrab of Ukraine&amp;#8217;s southern peninsula in 2014. Supporters argue his work has helped preserve Crimea&amp;#8217;s ancient heritage, but critics say he is no better than a looter of Ukrainian history making the most of Russia&amp;#8217;s occupation.&amp;#8221;</description>

      <description>The Conversation: &amp;#8220;In our recent article we explained how we see this difference, and why the work of restitution restores people’s power over their future, and gives them a sense of agency. We argue that, for its part, repatriation has come to represent something less concerned with community restoration and has more to do with an administrative and logistical exercise.&amp;#8221;</description>

      <title>As Gambling Apps Grow, Bettors are Slated to Owe More in Taxes This Year</title>
      <link>https://gizmodo.com/as-gambling-apps-grow-bettors-are-slated-to-owe-more-in-taxes-this-year-2000703073</link>
      <description>Gizmodo: &amp;#8220;The change, which was part of the Republican-authored and Donald Trump-supported One Big Beautiful Bill signed into law this summer, will impose a tax cap that limits gambling loss deductions to 90% of winnings, down from 100% in previous years. That will go into effect for 2026 income. So while it won’t necessarily impact your 2025 tax filings, it will hit gamblers when they go to file their taxes for 2026 come April of 2027.&amp;#8221;</description>

      <description>University of Maine: &amp;#8220;From interpreting a medical scan to sorting family photos, artificial intelligence (AI) makes snap judgments users often trust blindly.

      <description>How-To Geek: &amp;#8220;For decades, there were no known copies of UNIX Fourth Edition, with only some source code and manuals surviving to the present day.

The tape was delivered to the Computer History Museum, and has now been digitized and uploaded to the Internet Archive.&amp;#8221; Good afternoon, Internet&amp;#8230;</description>

But the images were shared on Snapchat, an app that deletes messages seconds after they’re viewed, and the adults couldn’t find them. The principal had doubts they even existed. Among the kids, the pictures were still spreading.

      <title>Hardware Store Marauder’s Map Is Clarkian Magic</title>
      <link>https://hackaday.com/2025/12/20/hardware-store-marauders-map-is-clarkian-magic/</link>
      <description>Hackaday: &amp;#8220;The &amp;#8216;Marauder’s Map&amp;#8217; is a magical artifact from the Harry Potter franchise. That sort of magic isn’t real, but as Arthur C. Clarke famously pointed out, it doesn’t need to be — we have technology, and we can make our own magic now. Or, rather, [Dave] on the YouTube Channel Dave’s Armoury can make it.&amp;#8221; Good evening, Internet&amp;#8230;</description>

      <link>https://mashable.com/article/chatgpt-personality-settings-lets-users-choose-warmer-bot</link>
      <description>Mashable: &amp;#8220;The new tools add more fine tuning of ChatGPT&amp;#8217;s personality using levels of warmth and enthusiasm (labelled as &amp;#8216;more,&amp;#8217; &amp;#8216;less,&amp;#8217; or &amp;#8216;default&amp;#8217;). Users can also adjust the way the bot organizes its responses, such as how frequently it generates lists, as well as the amount of emojis it employs, in addition to its base style and tone. There&amp;#8217;s still no option to exclude emojis entirely.&amp;#8221;</description>

      <description>Tubefilter: &amp;#8220;In the memo, which was viewed by Axios, TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew told his staff that TikTok U.S. will be sold to a consortium led by tech company Oracle, private equity firm Silver Lake, and Emerati-backed investors at MGX. The deal still needs to be officially rubber-stamped by the Chinese government (more on that in a bit), but Chew wrote that the deal is expected to close on January 22, 2026.&amp;#8221;</description>

      <description>International Business Times: &amp;#8220;A hack on the startup Doublespeed has uncovered a secretive network of 1,100 smartphones used to run hundreds of AI-generated TikTok accounts. Pexels Recent discoveries of phone farms reveal a massive operation where AI-generated influencers are saturating TikTok with hidden advertisements. These automated accounts mimic real creators so effectively that many viewers fail to realise they are watching a programmed marketing campaign. As technology advances, the line between genuine content and silent digital promotion continues to vanish.&amp;#8221;</description>
