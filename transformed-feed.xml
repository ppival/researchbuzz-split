A project in progress, it’s currently focused on how to reliably perform detection without resorting to using a camera itself.

      <description>WrestleZone: &amp;#8220;WWE owns decades of historic footage, and for the past few years, all of it has lived on Peacock instead of the WWE Network. The setup might change soon as Fightful Select reported that WWE’s streaming deal with Peacock ends at the end of 2026. This leads many fans to wonder what will happen to WWE’s massive video library.&amp;#8221;</description>

      <description>Online Journalism Blog: &amp;#8220;Carefully curated explainers might not boost the ego of a reporter who sees themselves as a dogged news hound, but we should probably still be writing them to serve audiences and compete with AI-generated alternatives — especially given their propensity to repeat false claims. It is particularly the case if we are have any mission to give a voice to the voiceless — by definition underrepresented in AI training data.&amp;#8221;</description>

      <description>The Register: &amp;#8220;The advisory body found that datacenter power use remains largely constant, with major demand changes typically coming from business expansion. Operators routinely reserve excess capacity for potential future growth, blocking other users from that allocation even though it sits unused.&amp;#8221;</description>

      <description>ACLU Northern California: &amp;#8220;Landlords may say &amp;#8216;smart home&amp;#8217; devices are a tenant convenience. But the reality is, these AI-enabled systems can track patterns of tenant behavior, identify when people are home, and provide landlords with personal information that could be used to push out tenants perceived as too costly.&amp;#8221;</description>

      <description>Medical Xpress: &amp;#8220;A comprehensive webpage-based database, named as IMgateway, currently offers rigorous, evidence-based information on the integration of complementary and conventional medicine but has lacked data on Chinese herbal medicines—until now. A research team, led by Dr. Phoebe Zhou at the National Institute of Complementary Medicines, has added new data to fill this gap, detailing 540 general Chinese herb–drug interactions and 607 individual reports.&amp;#8221;</description>

      <title>The Internet forgets, but I don’t want to</title>
      <link>https://alexwlchan.net/2025/social-media-scrapbook/</link>
      <description>Alex Chan: &amp;#8220;I want to remember social media, and not just as a vague memory. I want to remember exactly what I read, what I saw, what I wrote. If I was born 50 years ago, I’m the sort of person who’d keep a scrapbook full of letters and postcards – physical traces of the people who mattered to me. Today, those traces are digital. I don’t trust the Internet to remember for me, so I’ve built my own scrapbook of social media. It’s a place where I can save the posts that shaped me, delighted me, or just stuck in my mind.&amp;#8221;</description>

Then, at the annual streamer event TwitchCon in October, a man from the crowd grabbed Emiru and tried to kiss her without her consent.&amp;#8221;</description>

      <description>Mashable: &amp;#8220;According to a new study published this week in Nature, audiovisual glitches can have far-reaching affects on users that extend beyond expected nuisances, but which have the power to fundamentally impact major areas of our life, including the outcome of a job interview, trust in medical professionals, and the result of legal proceedings. And for people who don&amp;#8217;t have reliable internet access, including digitally disconnected, rural, or low-income households, the impact may be even more severe.&amp;#8221;</description>

      <description>New York Times: This link goes to a gift article. &amp;#8220;Smugglers, money launderers and people facing sanctions once relied on diamonds, gold and artwork to store illicit fortunes. The luxury goods could help hide wealth but were cumbersome to move and hard to spend. Now, criminals have a far more practical alternative: stablecoins, a cryptocurrency tied to the U.S. dollar that exists largely beyond traditional financial oversight.&amp;#8221;</description>

      <description>MIT Technology Review: &amp;#8220;OpenAI is testing another new way to expose the complicated processes at work inside large language models. Researchers at the company can make an LLM produce what they call a confession, in which the model explains how it carried out a task and (most of the time) owns up to any bad behavior.&amp;#8221;</description>

      <title>UNC-Chapel Hill study shows AI can dramatically speed up digitizing natural history collections</title>

      <description>University of North Carolina: &amp;#8220;A new study from UNC-Chapel Hill researchers shows that advanced artificial intelligence tools, specifically large language models (LLMs), can accurately determine the locations where plant specimens were originally collected, a process known as georeferencing. This task has traditionally been slow, expensive and dependent on significant manual effort. The team found that LLMs can complete this work with near-human accuracy while being significantly faster and more cost-effective.&amp;#8221; Good afternoon, Internet&amp;#8230;</description>

      <description>This newsletter is free but most of the things that go into making it aren&amp;#8217;t! Help me afford new socks and fancier bean stew by Not interested in commitment? Perhaps you’d buy me an iced tea. Don&amp;#8217;t have any money but still want to support? I know how that feels. Nobody reads my nonsense. Shall I tell you a thing or two? I need to buy new shoes because these have holes in them, but I&amp;#8217;m waiting until after we move. Share this newsletter or tell a friend about it. I live at Calishat. See my other nonsense at SearchTweaks, RSS Gizmos, Local Search America, WikiTwister, and MiniGladys.</description>
